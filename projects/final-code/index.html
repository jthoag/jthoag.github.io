<h1>Masters of the Masters</h1>

<h2>Background of the Masters</h2>


<body>


<body style="background-color:#B1B04A;">

<p>The Masters is an annual major golf event. The Masters is considered to be one of the most famous tournaments in all of golf's history. Unlike other major championships every year it is held at the beautiful Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia. It is one of four major championships in golf. It is the first of the four to occur and usually takes place in the first week of April. The tournament in total is four days long going from Thursday-Sunday. After Friday the field is cut down. So making it to the weekend at the Masters is a challenge in itself. The Masters were first founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts. The first ever Masters was played 87 years ago on March 22, 1934. The field of players for the Masters tournament is smaller than all the other major championships because this tournament is invitational only. When asked about what he thinks of the Masters, Univeristy of Maryland's Club Golf Vice President, Alex Pak said, "Magnolia Lane, the drive when you first enter the ground for Augusta national, there is just so much history everywhere you go."
The tournament is an official money event of the PGA Tour, the European Tour, and the Japan Golf Tour. The prize money for winning the Masters is of course the famous green jacket, a trophy, your name forever engraved in the big trophy in the main clubhouse, and of course the $11.5 million.</p>


<h2>Longest Average Drive</h2>

<h3>Tour Average: 295.6 yards</h3>

<p>Driving is important to every golfer's game. A drive, also known as a tee shot, is usually a long distance shot. You hit your driver with a club called a driver. It will be the largest club in a golfers bag and have the largest club face. Its purpose is to move the ball as close as you can to the green while trying to keep it on the fairway. The drive is the longest shot the golfer will hit. The average PGA Tour golfer hits their driver about 290 yards, which to put to scale is practically three football fields lined up. Some players' averages differ from other players. In this section we will look at who hits their drives, on average, the farthest on the PGA Tour.</p>

<h3>Bryson DeChambeau: 321.1 yards</h3>

<p>Known for his long drives DeChambeau is the 6th ranked golfer in the PGA Tour. He is from the United States. He has won eight times on the PGA Tour including a major championship. Despite leading the tournament in average driving distance DeChambeau still finished towards the bottom of the field.</p>

<h3>Cameron Champ: 318.3 yards</h3>

<p>Champ is a golfer from the United States. He has only recently turned professional, joining the tour in 2017. Despite being one of the leaders in average driving distance Champ still finished middle of the pack in 26th place.</p>

<h3>Rory Mcilroy: 318.2 yards</h3>

<p>One of the legends in the game Mcilroy is from Northern Ireland. He is part of the PGA Tour and is ranked 13th he is also on the European Tour. He has won the PGA Championship twice and has 27 professional wins throughout his career. Despite being at the top of the board for driving, Mcilroy didn’t even make the cut at this year's Masters tournament.</p>



<h2>Driver Club Head Speed/Ball Speed</h2>

<p>In recent years next gen stats have taken over almost every stat across every sport. With the new technology that is always being created we can calculate certain stats that were never possible to calculate 10 years ago. It brings a whole different side to a lot of these sports and really makes the sports more interesting. When asked about the these new next gen statistics Pak said, "I mean I think it's very interesting to see where the game is going, for example Bryson Dechambeau you see him hit the ball so fast and hard but it doesn’t seem to translate for him to the rest of his game."
Two of these intriguing next gen stats are driver club head speed and ball speed. To hit a driver over 300 yards you would think you have to get that club head moving pretty fast but it is different for every player because everyone has a different swing. Some might hit the ball with insanely quick club speed and some might not and the ball will still go the same distance.</p>

<h3>Bryson DeChambeau: Club Head: 133.03 mph, Ball Speed: 191.48 mph</h3>

<p>Known for his long drives DeChambeau is the 6th ranked golfer in the PGA Tour. He is from the United States. He has won eight times on the PGA Tour including a major championship. Despite leading the tournament in average driving distance, club head speed and ball speed DeChambeau still finished towards the bottom of the field.</p>

<h3>Cameron Champ: Club Head: 128.21, Ball Speed: 190.83 mph</h3>

<p>Champ is a golfer from the United States. He is ranked 77th on the PGA Tour. He has only recently turned professional, joining the tour in 2017. Despite being one of the leaders in average driving distance, club head speed and ball speed Champ still finished middle of the pack in 26th place.</p>

<h3>Rory Mcilroy: Club Head: 122.95 mph, Ball Speed: 183.06 mph</h3>

<p>One of the legends in the game Mcilroy is from Northern Ireland. He is part of the PGA Tour and is ranked 13th he is also on the European Tour. He has won the PGA Championship twice and has 27 professional wins throughout his career. Despite being at the top of the board for driving, club head speed, and ball speed, Mcilroy didn’t even make it past the cut at this year's Masters tournament.</p>



<h2>One Putt Percentage</h2>

<p>On the complete opposite side of the spectrum you have putting. Putting in golf is performed with the club called the putter. When asked about putting Pak said, "I would say it's the most difficult part especially at the Masters and Augusta. At every major tournament the pros get a green reading book and Augusta doesn’t have those. So reading putts is more difficult out at Augusta for the pros unless you have experience on the course." There are a lot of factors that go into putting and it is definitely the hardest stroke to master in the game of golf. The putter is probably the club you will hit the softest. Some of these factors are the softness or hardness of the greens, the wind, temperature, condition of the greens, slope on the greens, and speed of the greens. One putting for PGA Tour golfers is still a challenge even though they are professionals. A one putt is when you get your ball onto the green and then in one stroke (putt) you hit your ball into the hole.</p>

<h3>Patrick Reed: 45.99% (298 one putts on 648 holes)</h3>

<p>Reed is a professional golfer from the United States. His world PGA Tour ranking is seventh. He is known for his very impressive short game. Reed won the Masters in 2018 and has nine total professional wins under his belt. Reed tied for eighth in this past year's Masters.</p>

<h3>Anirban Lahiri: 45.47% (311 one putts on 684 holes)</h3>

<p>Lahiri is a professional golfer from India. He currently plays on the Asian Tour and the PGA Tour. He is not currently ranked on the PGA Tour and did not compete in the past Masters but has been part of the tournament before on several other occasions.</p>

<h3>Justin Thomas: 45.44% (336 one putts on 756 holes)</h3>

<p>Thomas is a professional golfer from the United States. His current PGA Tour world ranking is two. He is currently a part of the PGA Tour, European Tour and the Web.com Tour. Thomas has 16 career professional wins and is a very celebrated golfer. In this past year's Masters he finished tied for 21st place.</p>


<h2>Scoring Average</h2>

<p>Unlike a lot of other sports where the higher your score is the better, in golf it's actually the other way around. The lower your score in golf the better your score is. Scoring in golf can be very confusing for people that do not watch golf. Let's break it down. Each golf course has a par, the par of a course is the amount of strokes it would take an expert golfer to complete the course. Players can either be on par, under par, or over par. Your score is based off of that course's specific par. The course par usually ranges from 68-72 strokes. Your typical championship golf course will usually have a par of 72 that includes, four par threes, ten par fours, and four par fives. If the course par is a 72 and you shoot a 70 then your final score would be -2, which is considered two under. Each hole at a golf course has its own par too; they range from par 3 to par 5. If you are two under par its called an Eagle, if you are one under par it's a birdie, if you are on par and it's a par four hole that means you took four strokes to finish the hole, if you go one stroke over the par than its a bogey, two strokes over bar is double bogey.</p>

<h3>Russell Henley: 69.708</h3>

<p>Henley is a professional golfer from the United States who plays on the PGA Tour. He is currently ranked 59th in the world rankings and has six professional victories in his career. He has received invitations to the Masters before but did not in the past years.</p>
