 	<h1>Justin Hoagland's Portfolio</h1>
 	

 <h2>About/Bio</h2>
 	<p>I grew up outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in Vallye Forge but I call a lot of places home. Currently I am a junior enrolled at the Univeristy of Maryland's Philip Merrill School of Journalism. I am studying multi-platform journalsim and am interested in going into the sports journalsim field or the public relations field. I do not know whether I like print or broadcast journalism more but I am leaning towards print. I love everything sports and could talk about sports for hours and that's what really got me interested in this career path. Some personal facts about me, I played baseball, basketball and sailed all growing up and I have a twin brother.<p/>
