  <h1>About Justin Hoagland</h1>

  <hr>
 	
 	<p>I grew up outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in Valley Forge but I call a lot of places home. I grew up always knowing that I wanted to go into the sports field but didn't know what variation it would take. About halfway through my high school career I began managing my high school's basketball team. I had various jobs from working practices, doing the book, taking down individual statistics and calling the newspapers to report the final scores and statistics after games. From that point on is when you could say that journalism started to stand out to me as a field I might be interested in pursuing.</p>
 	<p>Flash to now and currently I am  enrolled at the Univeristy of Maryland's Philip Merrill School of Journalism. I am studying multi-platform journalsim and am interested in going into the sports journalsim field or the public relations field. I do not know whether I like print or broadcast journalism more but I am leaning towards print. I love everything sports and could talk about sports for hours and that's what really got me interested in this career path.</p>
 	<p>Some personal facts about me are that I played baseball, basketball and sailed competitively while growing up so that passsion for sports has always been in my life since I was young. I am Italian and love to cook meals with my family especially for holidays. I also have a twin brother.</p>
